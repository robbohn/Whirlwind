# LESSON 0: Starting Up

> Where we create our environment

## What we need:    

1. Text Editor - to create and modify text files
2. Command Line - to execute commands
3. Browser - to check our results 
4. Internet Access (for downloading tools and later lessons)


## What we don't need (at least initially)    

1. Web Server
2. other stuff (server, database, etc.)

> Discussion: Should tooling be separate from editing?


## Editors    

1. Simpler Editors: Notepad, SubLime/Atom/Brackets/Visual Studio Code/etc. 
2. Big "Development Environments": Visual Studio, WebStorm, et al
