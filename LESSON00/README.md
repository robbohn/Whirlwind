> Where we create our environment

## What we need:    

1. Text Editor - to create and modify text files
2. Command Line - to execute commands
3. Browser - to check our results 
4. Internet Access (for downloading tools and later lessons)


## What we don't need    

1. Web Server
2. other stuff (server, database, etc.)

> Discussion: Should tooling be separate from editing?


## Discuss editors    

1. Simpler Editors: SubLime and Atom and Visual Studio Code and NotePad++ 
2. Big "Development Environments": Visual Studio, WebStorm, et al


## Install VS Code    

    - ([link](http://code.visualstudio.com/))


## Create folder and startup VS Code via one of the following:

    1. **In Windows Explorer**
        - create a new folder   
        - right-click   
        - choose OPEN IN CODE   
            
    2. **In command shell/DOS:**
