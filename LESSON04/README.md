# LESSON 4A: Versioning & storing our work safely

> Where we track our changes and enable us to revert back when we screw up

## GIT
> Local Version Control    
> [more info](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)   

1. Make a repo
    - Click GIT icon on left
    - click `Initialize git repository`
    - displays list of your files
2. Commit your changes to the REPO
    - COMMIT ALL by clicking the CHECKMARK or pressing `CTRL-ENTER`    
        - __SAVING__ a file just saves it to your working directory
        - __COMMITTING__ means to write the files to the repository
    - if you have previously committed, committing again will ask for a MESSAGE describing the change(s)

## Make more changes 
> See what happens when we change the world

1. Make some minor changes to files (like add spaces to the end of a line)
    - notice GIT icon on left toolbar shows # files with changes
    - notice the word `master` in the lower left corner     
        - with an asterisk if un-committed changes have occurred    

2. Click the GIT icon, and see list of changed files not yet committed
    - click a FILE and see the comparison of before and after the changes
