# LESSON 5: Pretty it up! 

> Where we improve the looks (and make it mobile-responsive) by using a CSS framework 

## CSS Frameworks

1. BOOTSTRAP or similar
    - Bootstrap: ([download](http://getbootstrap.com/)) 
    - very simple alternative that does not require Javascript: <http://siimple.juanes.xyz/>    

2. Using CDNs for Bootstrap so you don't have to download!

    - Bootstrap CSS CDN is at <https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css>         
    - Bootstrap JS CDN is at <https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js>         

## Pros & Cons of CDNs such as [BootstrapCDN](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)

1. Pros
    - simultaneous download with your HTML and JS    
    - faster than your website    

2. CONs
    - what if the CDN is not working?


## Themes
